Indecisiveness gets the best of us, especially around dinner time. **WhatsForDinner**, a full-stack web application, can help you with that. You can start off by either choosing from our distinguished chefs or choosing from a full list of items offered by our chefs.

## Top Application Features

### Selecting Chefs

Users can select a individual Chef in one of two ways: 

1. Click on the Chef's container

    By click on an individual chef's card container, the user will then be redirected to the selected chef's show page.

2. Click the "Pick a Chef for me!" button. 

    Having trouble deciding which chef to go with? Simply click the "Pick a Chef for me!" button and the web application will choose a chef for you! By click the button, the .... function will generate a random number which will be used to key into the chef.

## Adding items into the cart

A user must be logged in in order to add items to the cart. Once logged in successfully, users have two options to add items into their cars:

1. through a chef's show page
2. from the item's page.
